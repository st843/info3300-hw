        Problem 1:
        A) Marks: counties outlined by borders, states outlined by borders
        Channels: varying the color hue of the counties

        B) Marks: blue rectangles
        Channels: varying the vertical aligned length and horizontal aligned position of the rectangles

        C) Marks: dots
        Channels: varying the color hue, color luminosity, horizontal aligned position, and vertical aligned position of the dots

        Problem 2:
        a) A. Number is a canonical type.
        B. <script> 
            console.log(typeof(2));
        </script>
        C. Strange behavior for number is type coercion - for example, 1 + "2" results in 12. Also, irrational numbers such as pi are also type number.

        b) int is not a canonical type. Int is type number.

        c) Unicode is not a canonical type. Unicode is type string.

        d) Array is not a canonical type. Array is an object.

        e) Char is not a canonical type - it is type string.

        f) Class is not a canonical type - it is type object.

        g) regex is not a canonical type - it is type object.

        h) A. string is a canonical type.
        B. <script>
            console.log(typeof("info3300"));
        </script>
        C.
